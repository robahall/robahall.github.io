This blog is set up to be tutorials using AWS for machine learning. The focus is twofold. The first is so I can reference how I set something up so I can easily repeat and understand why I did that.
The second is there seems to be a lack of blogs specifically related to setting up AWS for ML so hopefully this will help those data scientists and engineers. 
It will walkthrough many aspects and include optimizations and minimizing costs. Things most blogs hand wave over including setting up VPC and ensuring security will be covered. Older topics I had previously discussed
such as statistics and time series data will be kept and occasionally new content will be added.
