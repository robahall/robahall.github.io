Hi. This blog is set up to be a collection of discussions on how to use Python for designs of experiments.
I'm currently deep diving into this subject matter and will be showing how to use Python with design of experiments
dealing with experimental chemistry. In the process I'll be exploring exploratory data analysis, setting up factorial experiments,
statistical analysis of the experiments, visualizations, modeling, and what to do next all in Python!
Additionally, I will occasionally add other projects and musing on to this blog.
